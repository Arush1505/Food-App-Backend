# Food-App-Backend
I made this backend part just to bring my knowledge about express,node and mongo in a project.

Make an env file and place the mongo db connection  string in it.


About the Files:
config : has the model checking -> I used Mongo DB atlas for this.
controllers: contain the file for the main logic and extraction part.
middleware: used as a security step before accessing controllers file . (in some necessary scenarios).
models : design of the schemas of the models.
routes: contains the routes for different controllers files.

Front-end part will be made in future.
